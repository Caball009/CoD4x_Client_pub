# CoD4x_Client_pub
Client modifications of CoD4 X - this will not be the same as the official released files and you wont be able to join all servers with it.
This client can at the moment join servers which have the latest version 19.x installed but running without the steam-integration.
If you have additions which fit well and are seen as generally useful they might appear in the official release.

You need Mingw in version:
Thread model: win32 
gcc version 8.1.0 (i686-win32-dwarf-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project)

Using other version could result in linker errors.

Instructions to build client the first time:


Run ./compiledll-release.cmd
